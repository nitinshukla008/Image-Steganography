Steganography is the method of hiding data in Images so that it cant be seen with our naked eyes
This is a clean coded application in cryptography domain totally coded in java
This Application helps in establishing an undisclosed Communication betwwen the sender and reciever using Symmetric enctyption and ecryption technique.
The data we entered is encrypted in the image we selected using a private key and it can be decrypted by only the same private key used by recieved.
The resolution wont be decreased despite how big the data is encrypted in Image
The Algorithm used to encrypt and decrypt is Novel Steganogrpahy algorithm.
